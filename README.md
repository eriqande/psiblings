# psiblings

This implements a pseudolikelihood approach to sibling reconstruction that Hans Skaug
and I cooked up while he was visiting Santa Cruz.  ECA is in the process of trying
to turn it into a nice R package for portability.  Then we will finish up the manuscript
(not currently included in the repository) and submit it.
